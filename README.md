# CMYK
## A Node.js content management application

CMYK is very much so a work in progress with several goals:
- Act as a headless GraphQL CMS.
- Easy integration and setup through docker.
- 100% Flow coverage.
- Follow atomic design pattern.

This project is also an example of how I believe one should structure React / Redux applications. I'm going to move forward with the following technologies:

[react](http://reactjs.com/) / [redux](http://redux.js.org/) / [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) / [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) / [apollo](https://apollodata.com/) / [docker](https://docker.com/) / [flow](http://flow.org/) / [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) / [babel](https://babeljs.io/) / [eslint](http://eslint.org/) / [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)

More to come soon...
